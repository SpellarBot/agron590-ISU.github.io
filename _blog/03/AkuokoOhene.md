1. How can relational databases help you with your research?
In my research we are collecting multiple sets of continuous data. The research is in its first real year so there isn't overwhelmig amounts of data, but there are many variables and possible ways that the data could be tabulated. Also most of the data is rawdata and will need to be further analyzed through multiple calculations. A relational dataset would help organize the multiple variables taken and calulated, and also help me identify and solve issues in the datasets that may come.

2. Is there any aspect of them that makes them a poor fit for you?
I dont think that it they would necessary be a poor fit, but there may be some functions I may need and use less than others. For instance, I would say SQL Like is a function that I would use as SQLGLob can do the same query as Like but with an even larger capacity.
  
3. What other types of databases are there?
From what I found in the article there are other forms of relational databases such as Oracle, SQLServer, and MySQL. From Google I also found a number of non-relational databases such as Hadoop/NoSQL, Virtualized Databases, Columnar databases, and In-memory databases that fall under thaat category.
