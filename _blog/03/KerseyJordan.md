##NEVER HAVE USED ANY OF THE THINGS WE'VE LEARNED, but I feel so much more prepared to manage data in the future!

1. Despite my lack of experience with data, or research, I feel as though relational databases could be extremely helpful in managing a large project which had many components. I'm considering hearing of other's current research, and how many details it includes, and it makes me feel like there should be some kind of "world" that holds all of this data and keeps it all organized.  It seems handy to be able to reorganize, and redistribute pieces with others through a program like SQLite.  Also, from the perspective of someone who is very new to any kind of coding, SQL seems very user-friendly, which is very appealing on my end! 

2. At this point, the only reason they do not seem useful is because I don't really have much data to manage (long-term)...

3. I wasn't sure about other kinds of databases... but Google informed me there are many kinds! Hierarchical Models, Network Models, Object-Relational Models, Object-Oriented Models, Semistructured Models, Associative Models, Context Models. It appears there is a lot to learn... and all kinds of preferences to make depending upon what need is at hand and how one like to operate.
