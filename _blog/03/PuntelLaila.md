1. How can relational databases help you with your research? 

    Relational databases will help managing large, complex datasets where many variables are being measured on a same object. Hard to believe sometimes my current job is more data-challenging that my PhD..but I have been trying to avoid it. I worked in precision agriculture business providing data-intensive field characterization and variables rate advising for farmers. For every year, every field, and every locations (sometimes 1 point per second) is being recorded. That involves a geographic position associated with many different attributes. At the same time every machinery after doing a labor at the field (e.g variable rate application of fertilizer) will outputted a map with more data showing the actual rates applied to the field. Long story short, we accumulate tons of data for every single client and is growing very very fast .scary. And the most exciting part is that it nerves stop! Definitely, if rational database can help with complex data sets it have become my new best friends.

2. Is there any aspect of them that makes them a poor fit for you? I guess the fact that I don't know much about them is what makes them have a poor fit so far.whenever I heard what they were meant to be, there is not possible reason for databases to not fit you!! 
3. What other types of databases are there?
    Apparently, there is another type of databases called "Non-relational databases". Public sell them as:
    -	Good for any type of data.literally aby type!
    -	Good for scaling up within data and across regions
    -	Apparently they are cheaper
    Mean time. they need more marketing!
