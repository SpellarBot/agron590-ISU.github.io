After reading the article on normalization, I feel like I incorporate some of the points made in the article, such as avoiding redundancy. It is nice, however, to see normalization presented as a standard that is reproducible. In the future, should I ever be in charge of a lab or people entering data, I will be sure to visit these standards as well as those from last week. I feel this area (data structure/entry) was not strongly emphasized in any of the labs that I have worked in up till now. Years of undergrads on a revolving door policy meant many forms of data in all sorts of configurations. Instead of the most recent hire normalizing old data to their "normal", an enforced standard that carries through the years would be much more practical.
