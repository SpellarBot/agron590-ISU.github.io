## The normal forms

First normal form decrees that my data must be rectangular.

Second normal form says that non-key fields need to refer to the entire composite key. If it pertains to only subset of a key a new table should be made to reduce redundancy.

Third normal form says that non-key fields should only describe key fields, not other non-key fields.

Fourth and Fifth normal forms are really picky, and you have to make really small decomposed tables to satisfy them. I'd rather have a few large ones.

MRW I realize it's 2120 and I haven't finished my blog post, but I can only access the vm through my work computer:
