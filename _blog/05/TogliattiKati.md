## Blog 5:


Data tidying is structuring datasets to facilitate analysis. There are three steps to follow when creating tidy data.

1.Each variable forms a column.
2.Each observation forms a row.
3.Each type of observational unit forms a table.

This relates to what we have already talked about in class because we have been discussing how to make excel sheets that everyone can read. We have also been learning ways to work better with groups, and if you have tidy data then everyone will be able to use it easier. 

The time when tidy data seems like it would not be helpful is if someone does not know how to use the tidy tools that are available. This could potentially make analysis more timely and difficult. 

Overall, having tidy data and using the tidy tools seems like it will be very useful to learn. This will hopefully make data analysis easier in the future.
