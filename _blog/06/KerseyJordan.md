This was an interesting read, despite my being unfamiliar with "S" or "Scheme", this was a good insight into the creation of R and the things it tried to succesfully change within the programming for data analysis world. 

I found the part about memory management to be fairly enlightening.  Having just entered into the voyage of learning programming, I can honestly say I had not thought about this (key) piece of the story.  How one can store so much information, in as little space as possible blows my mind.  I can assume that the management of this large amount of data is HUGELY important (to those who frequently use and store in R, or the like).  

Although a lot of this read was a bit above my head... I still feel I grasped how much of an improvement the creation of R was, from previously available programs.  I do think that its nice to hear how influences from the past were very central to the beginning of this program.  

I look forward to furthering my adventure into data analysis with something like R at my side, and hopefully will only become more well-adapted to managing and sharing my files in a way which is very presentable and "tidy".  It's good to learn the background of something, before diving in, so I am content with knowing that perhaps more of this publication will make better sense with time.
