## **S**plit **A**pply **C**ombine (SAC)

SAC is a processing method where data is split into groups, some function is applied as required, and the results are combined into a specified output. This technique has the advantage of allowing for clearer code; intent that could be lost in for loops is now easily visible. We have (unknowingly) used this strategy in class while working with SQL. We would group our database selection and then perform functions on it.

Sidebar: I had never heard of star glyphs before, but they look kind of cool for display spatially varying time-series data (like mine).
