In the presentation Hadley Wickham gave at the useR! conference June 29th, 2016, he talks more about his efforts to integrate and streamline data processing and data management. He describes a standard format for data called "tidy data" as well as several integrated tools that have been developed to utilize the predictable format of tidy data in an intuitive and informative way. I think this is a very noble endeavor. This makes data manipulation and analysis in R more available to people who are less experienced with R and other programming languages and expands the capacity and ease of use for more experienced R users. Many fields of research can benefit from an opportunity to work with their data more intuitively, making the impact of tidy data far-reaching. I can imagine that as time passes, the ease of use and integration between packages will only get better.
