The first thing that really stuck with me, from this video, was the idea of using IDs when plotting.  This makes a lot of sense, considering plotting is easier with numerical values, rather than characters. It would be simpler to show the progression of something by assigning descending or ascending order to a string of variables.

"Tibbles are lazy, surly data frames"- forces you to confront any issues in a timely sense, and not just leave them to become more of a problem later. I enjoyed this bit, and I would definitely like to explore using tibble, more.

R is more of a means of interactive exploration than just a programming system.  I would definitely agree with this. Although you can use it to write a simple command, giving yourself an output, and storing data, one can also use it as a way to play around with plots and other ways of expressing trends and other analysis of data sets.  This is extrememly helpful when attempting to find new, more exciting ways of using data to support ones hypothesis, and I think it could be very helpful in future endeavor.

I really enjoyed the bit of this lecture about "the pipe". I agree, that makes things easier to read and understand.  My biggest complaint with R, currently, is that I am not very familar with the syntax, and so the idea of doing new things or looking back at past work, is very complicated for me, and takes a significant amount of time to review and re-work through what I did.  I think that this way of organizing data and putting it into plots, etc., would be helpful to me.

I think that data analysis will only become more expansive with time, and will allow for even more freedom to create new, and original ways of visualizing data sets.
