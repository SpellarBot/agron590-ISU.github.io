**Towards a grammar of interactive graphics**

Wickham has made an impressive work! Surprisely enough he is a Chief Scientist at Rstudio. He talked about R as a great tool to import, "tidy", transform, reshape, visualize, and model the data to be able to communicate. He was very enthusiast about how much R can improve your life and make it more "fun". He created very worldwide user friendly functions that are super useful for this purposes. Basically, he present this set of tools as an efficient way to satisfy the need of having tidy data (uniform) for data analysis. 

Besides this main things, he made a lot of focus and gave examples on how to keep the code "tidy" by using the pipe method within the "tidy APIS". This tool has been very useful since basically it can be read it as sentence and it very intuitive for humans. Also, Hadley describe that one of advantages of R is base on the ability to use old code even with early versions.   
As a take home message I liked having as a rule if you are copying and pasting something more than 3 times , will be better to go back and replace that with some of the function that could replace that extra coding. This will also help to keep your code clean and organized.


Where do you see the future of data analysis going?

Data analysis in the way that has been presented in this video is going to be a more common thing, highly required for data sharing and communication. I think that most of the people working with data (not necessarily big data sets) will have to learn and apply the tools we are learning in this class.
