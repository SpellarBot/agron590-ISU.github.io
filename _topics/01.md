## Prompt:

Talk about your worst experience with data. Try to think about what made this experience stand out in your mind and why it was so difficult. If you could have changed one or two things about the situation, what would you prioritize?

{% assign num_posts = site.blog | size %}
{% if num_posts > 0 %}
## Class posts:

<ul>
{% for post in site.blog %}
  {% if page.topic == post.topic %}
  <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }} by {{ post.author }}</a></li>
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endif %}
