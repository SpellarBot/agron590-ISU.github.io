## Prompt:

Read the article [Relational Databases Aren’t Dead. Heck, They’re Not Even Sleeping](http://readwrite.com/2013/03/26/relational-databases-far-from-dead/) and reflect on three things.  

1. How can relational databases help you with your research?
2. Is there any aspect of them that makes them a poor fit for you?
3. What other types of databases are there?
