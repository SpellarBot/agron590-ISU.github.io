## Prompt:

Watch Donald Knuth's talk at useR!2016 ["Literate Programming"](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/Literate-Programming) and write a blog post on your thoughts. How have his ideas about literate programming been implemented today? What differences can you see between his vision and our current reality?
