## Prompt:

Read Helen Shen's article ["Interactive notebooks: Sharing the code"](http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261) and write a blog post on your thoughts. What is the significance of a journal like *Nature* publishing about the use of dynamic documents such as interactive notebooks? What do you think it will take for reproducibility and dynamic documents to go mainstream?
