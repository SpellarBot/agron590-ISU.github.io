  <h4>Course objectives</h4>
  <p>There is a need for data stewardship in Earth systems science due to the scale and complexity brought about by simultaneously examining many natural phenomena and their interactions.  Large, multi-investigator field experiments and datasets generated by the accumulation of data over time, automated data collection, and simulation models demand researchers capable of working beyond basic spreadsheets. However, students currently have little opportunity to learn fundamental data skills required for successful, collaborative, and reproducible research. AGRON 590RD will address this gap within the context of plant, soil, and atmospheric sciences by providing instruction to students ranging from those that have had little exposure to methods of working with data to students that have experience with data-heavy applications, but wish to improve the way in which they work.
